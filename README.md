# Background Task Job System

## Overview
This project implements a system to manage and execute background tasks. It is designed to handle asynchronous jobs efficiently, allowing the main application to continue running without waiting for the completion of long-running processes.

---

## Features
- **Asynchronous Task Execution:** Execute tasks in the background without blocking the main application.
- **Job Queue Management:** Organize and prioritize tasks in a queue.
- **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:** Handle failures gracefully and retry tasks as needed.
- **Task Scheduling:** Schedule tasks for delayed execution.
- **Monitoring:** Track task status (e.g., Pending, Running, Completed, Failed).

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9.6
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Virtual Environment (venv)
- Required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application (if using a web interface):
   ```
   http://localhost:<port>
   ```

---

## Docker Setup

### Dockerfile
A `Dockerfile` is included to containerize the application. Key steps include:
- Use an official Python base image.
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Set up the application.

Example:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "app.py" ]
```

### Docker Compose
The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define and run multi-container setups. An example configuration includes the app service and a Redis service for task queue management:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - redis

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

### Running the Application
1. Start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Stop the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Usage

### Adding a Task
To add a task, use the API endpoint `/add-task` or the task scheduler function in the application.

Example:
```python
from tasks import background_task

# Queue a task
background_task.delay(task_arg1, task_arg2)
```

### Monitoring Task Status
You can check the status of a task using its unique ID. An example API endpoint for monitoring is `/task-status/<task_id>`.

### Scheduling Tasks
Schedule tasks to execute after a delay or at a specific time:
```python
from tasks import background_task

# Schedule a task for future execution
background_task.apply_async((arg1, arg2), countdown=60)  # Executes after 60 seconds
```

---

## Architecture
- **Queue Manager:** Manages task queue, prioritization, and assignment.
- **Worker Processes:** Processes tasks from the queue in parallel.
- **Task Result Backend:** Stores task results and statuses (e.g., Redis, PostgreSQL).

---

## Configuration
The configuration settings are available in `config.py`. Update the following parameters as needed:
- `BROKER_URL`: URL of the message broker (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ).
- `RESULT_BACKEND`: URL of the backend database to store task results.
- `MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retries for failed tasks.
- `TASK_TIMEOUT`: Timeout for task execution.

---

## Dependencies
Key dependencies:
- **Celery:** For managing and executing tasks.
- **Redis:** As a message broker.
- **Flask/Django:** (Optional) For API integration.

Install all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
